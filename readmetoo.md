# FAsm Updates

I have decided that I will update the language once a year, *except for patches and bugfixes*. I mean that seriously.

My idea is that you people can suggest ideas for the language over the course of the year, and over that year I will keep a local version of the files and update them with the ideas I think will fit. Then, at the end of the year, I release the version and you guys get to see what was added. Thanks for reading, and have fun!
